# Domoticz

Forked from the original Domoticz this is a Home Automation System that aims to be data rather than code driven.
This fork has the following key difference from the original:
-  A re-worked data model that addresses the increased complexity in Home Authomation devices in recent years
-  A re-worked RESTful API for accessing data
-  Angular 8 front end that allow users to create their own UI

## Multi platform: Linux/Windows

This system is designed to operate in various operating systems.
The user-interface is a scalable Angular 8 web frontend, and is automatically adapted for Desktop and Mobile Devices.
Compatible with all recent browsers
